``block_diag_ilu`` is an open source C++ header implementeation of an
incomplete LU decomposition routine suitable for diagonally dominant block diagonal
matrices with sub- and super diagonals of small magnitude. It is useful for 
preconditioning linear systems when e.g. integrating discretized PDEs of mixed
chemical kinetics / diffusion problems where the diffusion process may be accurately considered a mild perturbation.
